I trained this model using roughly 6000 data samples, which is 10% of the total dataset. Accuracy was approx 0.88 and loss was around 0.5.

Note that due to their large size its difficult to upload the training images - but they can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hojjatk/mnist-dataset
